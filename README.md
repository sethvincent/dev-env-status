## About

A desktop app to help new programmers set up a Node/JavaScript development environment on their computer for the first time.

Check to see if node, git, and other tools are installed.

### Work in progress

There are still some improvements that need to be made before ready for use. [Contributions are welcome.](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This project is based on [dev-env-status-check](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-env-status-check), a node library for checking a user's computer for needed dependencies.

### Planned improvements (PRs welcome!)

This module needs to be tested and adapted for use on both linux and windows.

Additional design improvements.

Links to additional documentation and better in-app contextual information about each of the tools.

For now this only checks node, npm, and git. It should check a user's system for dependencies like gcc, and we may want to check for things like atom and homebrew.

Check the [dev-env-status-check](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-env-status-check) repo for additional todos.
